# InfraForge 7X

> Forging the infrastructure behind intelligent systems.

### My Contributions
* Implemented Infrastructure State Integration layer and dynamic hardware metrics pipeline.
* Authored End-to-End (E2E) integration tests connecting workload profiling with execution dispatch.

**InfraForge 7X** is building **AFRI-EDGE**, an infrastructure-aware, workload-agnostic adaptive runtime for intelligent AI execution across Local, Edge, and Cloud environments.

## AI Infra Summit Hackathon 2026

This repository is the central engineering workspace for the team.

### Current MVP

**Primary use case:** Intelligent real-time video analytics.

**Core principle:**

> AGENTOS decides what to execute. AFRI-EDGE decides where and how to execute it.

The MVP evaluates workload requirements and real-time infrastructure conditions, selects an eligible execution target, routes the workload, observes execution, and can re-evaluate when conditions change.

### Competitive Extensions

- **SiMa.ai** — optional Edge / Physical AI execution adapter for compatible vision workloads.
- **Speechmatics** — optional speech capability demonstrating that the same routing core can handle another AI modality.

Sponsor technologies are adapters/capabilities, not hard-coded dependencies. The generic AFRI-EDGE MVP remains runnable without sponsor hardware or APIs.

### Development

The initial runtime uses **Python 3.11 + FastAPI** and is containerized with Docker/Docker Compose.

The first vertical slice is the routing flow:

`POST /route → Workload Profile → Infrastructure State → Decision Engine → Routing Decision`

### Engineering Workflow

`Issue → Feature Branch → Development → Tests → Pull Request → Review → Merge → Integration → Validation`

**Definition of Done:** Implemented + Tested + Integrated.
